libcc

An implementation of the standard C library, along with classic data
structures and algorithms.

The goal is to build a deep understanding at a level just above
assembly, where abstractions meet the hardware. This library will also
serve as a foundation for other projects built with the guiding
principle of "only using the code I write."
